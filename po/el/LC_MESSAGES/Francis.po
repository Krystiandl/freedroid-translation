"*sigh* Long stasis sleep can cause neurological damage and impact the "

"You are a Linarian, a species not native to this planet. Twenty of you "

msgid ""
"There was a... misunderstanding of some sort and humans welcomed your "

msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:66
msgid "A few of you survived the slaughter and went into hiding and obscurity."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:67
msgid ""
"During that time Linarians became known as helpers and heroes. Of course now "

"I was at a protest against MegaSys, a computer company. They killed free "
"software by finding a loophole in the GPL3.14 licence. It all became their "
"property. Bastards."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:77
msgid ""
"Lots of people were angry about this. Protests and riots spread in waves all "

"When the police bots approached at dawn, we thought that they were going to "

"I broke into a parked hover car and used it to escape. The sight from the "

"The city was full of flames, flashes of gunfire and screaming people. That "

msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:81
msgid "First we made them, and then they unmade us. How ironic."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:86
msgid "What happened then?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:88
msgid "I got shot down and I crashed a few kilometers away from here."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:89
msgid ""
"Later I learned that the bots started attacking all around the globe. The "
"journalists called it 'The Great Assault'. The name stuck."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:90
msgid ""
"Then the bots started jamming our broadcasts and long distance communication "

"This facility is located not too far away from a mining town where we have "

msgid ""
"There are just too few humans alive and awake to allow us to properly "

msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:101
msgid ""
"I try to do my best to make sure nothing goes bad here and all these people "

msgid "Why did the Linarians come to this world?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:108
msgid ""
"The planet you mean? No one knows that. None of you ever said anything about "

"This is a planetary system of ten planets, and we are presently located on "

"I am not an astronomer, so I could be wrong. I am too tired to keep track of "
"what is a planet and what is just an oversized rock."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:122
msgid "This could be just about anywhere. Your description is too ambiguous."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:123
msgid ""
"Sorry, star sciences are my weak point. Maybe someone in the town might know "

"I feel terrible... Was I asleep? I remember nightmares. A meteor shower "

msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:141
msgid ""
"This is normal. You were in stasis sleep for over 70 years. Stasis is not "
"too kind on the mind. Your strange dreams will keep recurring for several "
"years."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:142
msgid ""
"Whatever the reason was for putting yourself through this, it must have been "
"a damn good one."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:143
msgid ""
"You are lucky that I found you and woke you up. A few more decades in there "
"and you would end up insane."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:148
msgid "Tell me more about the town you mentioned."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:150
msgid "It is a small mining community of no more than 500 inhabitants..."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:151
msgid ""
"It was a stroke of luck that it did not get destroyed by the bots. Because "
"of poor funding, the city could not afford new models."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:152
msgid ""
"All they had at the time of the bot attack were the 614 battle bot "
"platforms. They were running an old operating system and were not affected "
"by whatever caused the other bots to go crazy."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:153
msgid ""
"Right now the place is protected by the Red Guard, a bunch of volunteers. I "
"cannot say I agree with their methods."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:154
msgid ""
"However, I must admit that being a prisoner of a walled town looks pretty "
"good compared to the alternative of being eviscerated alive."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:159
msgid "Why did the bots attack?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:161
msgid "We don't really know the reason for this insanity. However..."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:162
msgid ""
"All of the attacking bots are using a MegaSys operating system, so we think "
"they are responsible."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:163
msgid "Not surprisingly, the bastards deny everything."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:164
msgid ""
"Of course, because nearly every single bot in the world runs on that junk, "
"the situation does not look pretty."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:169
msgid "I also heard a voice... Someone calling himself Dvorak... "
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:171
msgid "Relax. Everything will be fine in a few hours."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:172
msgid "This is perfectly normal."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:177
msgid "Why not wake up all these people and attack the bots?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:179
msgid ""
"Well, some have a disease that can't be cured yet. Some are just old and "
"want to be woken up when technology can give them an extended life. Some "
"have other reasons."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:180
msgid ""
"But suffice it to say, most of these people are not really good at fighting. "
"Besides, we don't have enough weapons to mount a full scale counter attack "
"at present."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:181
msgid ""
"And an even bigger problem would be to feed everyone. Our food resources are "
"quite scarce. So for now they are better off sleeping."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:186
msgid "Can you tell me how to get to town?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:188
msgid ""
"Sure. You just need to follow the road outside to the east. After the "
"bridge, turn right and continue to follow the road and you will soon be "
"outside of the town main gate."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:189
msgid ""
"If you run across too many bots, you can try to circle around them. But "
"avoid getting too far off the road, so you don't get lost. It's very "
"dangerous out there."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:190
msgid ""
"Once in town you will be able to purchase or trade a few more items for "
"protection at Ms. Stone's shop just inside the town gate."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:195
msgid "How do I get out from here?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:197
msgid ""
"Oh, just take the small door and corridor out to the waiting room. And from "
"there you can get out through the customer entrance."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:198
msgid ""
"I keep the back entrance, close to my sleeping quarters, locked at all times "
"for safety reasons. Better safe than sorry."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:203
msgid ""
"It cannot be true. One company cannot control all of the bot software on a "
"whole world."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:205
msgid ""
"It can. They got close to a monopoly 30 years ago, but their last "
"competitor, the open source community, was defeated by them about a year ago."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:206
msgid ""
"Since then all of the newly made bots have been made with MegaSys firmware "
"burnt into their circuits."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:211
msgid "Why did you wake me up?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:213
msgid ""
"The situation at the town is not good. The walls are crumbling and we have "
"lost a lot of good people."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:214
msgid ""
"I heard the Linarians have a special gift for computers and can hack them "
"just by thinking about it."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:215
msgid ""
"Even if this is only partly true, we need it. The situation is quite ugly."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:216
msgid "We need you."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:221
msgid "Where are all my things?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:223
msgid "I already took out your chest with personal belongings from storage."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:224
msgid "It is standing there next to the door."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:225
msgid "Is that it?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:226
msgid "That is all the records show you had with you when your were frozen."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:227
msgid ""
"There are also some references to a bank account of yours, but as you "
"probably understand, there is no working banking system presently."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:232
msgid "The 614 bot said he might shutdown the outside gate!"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:235
msgid ""
"Oh. You'll need to put the cryogenic terminals into admin mode to access the "
"gate controls."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:236
msgid "How do I do that?"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:237
msgid ""
"You press star-pound-zero-six-pound and then enter the free-speech number."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:238
msgid "It is kind of long, so I'll write it down for you."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:239
msgid ""
"If the 614 bot locks the gate, it is for a good reason. Lock the gate behind "
"you!"
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:244
msgid "Thanks for the help. I'll be going now."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:246
msgid ""
"I am glad I could help you. You should be careful around here. Best head "
"straight for our town."
msgstr ""

#: Francis.dialog:247
msgid ""
"Remember to not veer too far off the path, or your quest could be over "
"before it begins."
