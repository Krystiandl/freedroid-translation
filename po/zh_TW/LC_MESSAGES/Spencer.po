"Ouch. It wasn't. At least I am alive, and the warehouse is clear. *Whew*."

"Poor guy, if we weren't in such a bad situation, he could have some work-"

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:149
msgid "You better don't bother him the next days."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:154

"He did rail against you though. He said he had to give you 400 circuits to "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:155
msgid ""
"That was nearly all money he had. He said you were too greedy to become a "

"I think everybody has to get a chance. But look ahead! When you are "

msgid "Bender's problem"
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:178
msgid ""
"Helping Bender along was also a smart move. But you should be very careful "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:180
msgid "As far as I know, Bender is still very sick."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:184
msgid ""
"But most importantly, I was very impressed with you when you cleared out the "
"warehouse. That was a huge deed I will never forget."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:186
msgid ""
"Personally I'm also worrying about how we will manage to get some necessary "
"supplies from our warehouse. It's filled with bots and we just don't have "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:191
msgid ""
"OK. Your list of achievements is long enough. You can join us. So I hereby "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:192
msgid ""
"But now that you are in the Guard, know this: There is only one rule for us "
"guards: We stick together. We survive together or we die together. But we do "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:193
msgid ""
"And now you might want to inspect the guard house. Tell Tybalt to open the "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I can't accept you into the guard like this. Get going. There are still many "

msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:209
msgid "I've heard Richard obtained new information on the town."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:211
msgid ""
"Yes, that's right, and in fact it might be crucial. As you may have heard, "
"the MS office is defended by a disruptor shield. They open it only to let "
"out new armies of bots."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:212
msgid ""
"The data on the cube he obtained indicates the existence of a secret "
"experimental facility in this region. Our findings suggest that they were "
"testing some new form of disruptor shield for MS, so the shield can be "
"controlled from that facility."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:213
msgid ""
"If the information is true, then you can take over the control droid and "
"disable the shield permanently so we can get in."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:214
msgid ""
"We know that MS had a firmware update system, which could be used to "
"propagate a malicious update to disable all bots. It is very alluring, but "
"to perform this trick you need to hack the control droid, which is in the "
"heart of the HF. To enter HF you would have to disable the disruptor shield."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:215
msgid ""
"This seems like a gift sent from the heavens. Cleaning the Hell Fortress is "
"not going to be easy, though.."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:220
msgid "I'd like to participate in this operation."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:222
msgid ""
"That's most kind of you to volunteer. So far, I've sent two scouts into the "
"area. They have found the facility entrance and unlocked the gate."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:223
msgid ""
"That is a good sign, because it shows that the key combinations from the "
"data cube were correct."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:224
msgid ""
"However, we lost contact with them shortly after they went inside. They also "
"reported heavy bot resistance."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:225
msgid ""
"I'd be glad if you could take a look. But use the utmost care. We can't "
"afford to lose another guard."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:230
msgid "OK. I'll be careful. But I'll do it."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:232
msgid ""
"Good. The base entrance is somewhat hidden in the caves to the northeast. "
"Best to use the north gate out of town, then head east, and turn north again "
"along the shore."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:233
msgid ""
"I wish you the best of luck for this operation. It might be that our "
"survival depends on it. Don't wait for assistance."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:234
msgid ""
"Try to get control over the disruptor shield if you can. The control droid "
"should be somewhere on the lowest level of the installation. Simply "
"destroying the droid might suffice in disabling the shield."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:235
msgid ""
"Spencer has revealed the information from the data cube evaluation to me. It "
"seems there is an old military research facility near the town. By taking "
"over the control droid, I should be able to control the disruptor shield at "
"the facility. I could activate it permanently, thereby locking off the Hell "
"Fortress, and the bots it's producing, forever. Alternatively, I could "
"disable it, and fight my way through the Hell Fortress droids until I reach "
"the main control droid and update it, thereby disabling all bots in the "
"entire area around town in one fell swoop."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:241
msgid "I don't feel like doing it now. I'd rather prepare some more."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:243
msgid "Good. You should be well prepared if you intend to go."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:244
msgid ""
"Also there is no need to hurry with this. After all, the installation is not "
"running away, so it's best to take a cautious approach."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:249
msgid ""
"It's done. Your soldiers were killed, but I managed to have a word with the "
"shield control droid. The access to the bot factory is now open."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:251
msgid ""
"Good. We cannot help you much in this final mission, but I can tell you what "
"our recon teams gathered behind the factory doors. You will enter a zone "
"that used to be a MS office."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:252
msgid ""
"They carried out some development there, and had part of their patching "
"division and update management department. The actual factory is located "
"behind the office."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:253
msgid ""
"With a bit of luck, you might not need to access it. We know they have their "
"update server in the office."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:254
msgid ""
"If you can find it and get it to propagate a faulty update, this could "
"suffice to stopping bots dead in their tracks."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:255
msgid ""
"Look for the entrance of the office in the crystal fields. I will send a "
"message to the guards so they let you pass. Then you will be on your own."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:256
msgid "Good luck."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:257
msgid "Propagating a faulty firmware"
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:257
msgid ""
"I can now enter the fortress and find the upgrade server bot. The fortress "
"gates are in the Crystal Fields. Spencer told the guards to open the doors "
"for me."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:262
msgid ""
"I will need some time to get myself ready before I clean up the Hell "
"Fortress."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:264
msgid "You had better be ready."
msgstr ""

#: Spencer.dialog:268
msgid "I'll be going then."
