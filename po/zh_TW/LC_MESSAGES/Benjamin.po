msgid "What are you doing here alone? "

#: Benjamin.dialog:52
msgid ""
"I'm experimenting with new designs. I want to redesign the laser pistol."

#: Benjamin.dialog:53
msgid ""
"A lot of energy is wasted somewhere during firing, and I have no idea where. "
"If I could find the source of the problem, the gun would become much more "
"powerful."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:54
msgid ""
"So far all my prototypes have failed. Mostly overheating and jamming. "
"Sometimes I wonder if I am doing something wrong."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:59
msgid ""
"Did you think about somehow gathering the excess heat and using it to make "
"the beam stronger?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:61
msgid "Hmm... There might be something in that idea. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:67
msgid "If I were you, I would focus my work on the firing rate."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:69
msgid "Hmm... I will think about it. Hmm..."

#: Benjamin.dialog:75
msgid ""
"You know, laser pistols are not a very promising weapon. I think you should "

msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:77
msgid "Yeah, maybe you are right. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:84
msgid "Can you teach me how to properly use rifles and guns?"

#: Benjamin.dialog:87
msgid ""
"If anyone in this city knows more about guns than me, then my name's not "

msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:88
msgid ""
"Of course, I will need compensation for the ammunition spent in the training "
"and for my time."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:89
msgid "Say... A hundred circuits should be enough for a beginner lesson."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:90 Benjamin.dialog:96 Benjamin.dialog:101
#: Benjamin.dialog:106 Benjamin.dialog:111
msgid "Interested?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:93
msgid "Oh, you are ready for some more training?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:94
msgid ""
"It will of course cost a bit more money as well as mental focus on your part."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:95
msgid ""
"It will take you two hundred circuits and double the effort on your part to "
"become a true apprentice."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:99
msgid "I see you have taken a liking to guns."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:100
msgid ""
"But the next step will cost even more money and require the mental focus "
"equaling all your previous training."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:104
msgid "Oh, you want to become a real master with shooters?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:105
msgid ""
"It will cost you 400 valuable circuits and an awful lot of mental focusing "
"on the task."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:109
msgid ""
"To become a true god of firearms, just like me, you need ridiculous amounts "
"of training."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:110
msgid ""
"It will of course cost a fair bit of cold, hard circuits as well. 500, to be "
"precise."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:114
msgid "Sorry, there is no human alive that could give you further training."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:120
msgid ""
"Sign up for a course in improving my ranged weapons skill. (cost 100 "
"circuits, 3 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:123
msgid "Yes, I'd like some basic training in ranged combat."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:126
msgid "Suits me well, I'm not busy at the moment anyway."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:127
msgid ""
"Now the most important thing is that you turn off the auto-aim on your "
"weapon, like this."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:128
msgid ""
"Otherwise your weapon might 'help' you and shoot somewhere you didn't intend "
"to fire."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:129
msgid "Next important thing is to remember how to properly fire a shot."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:130
msgid ""
"Watch your target closely. Pretend you're moving with it. Aim for the head."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:131
msgid ""
"When you feel completely in sync with your target, then you pull the trigger."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:132
msgid "Good. You are learning fast. Try it a few more times."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:133
msgid "Good. I think that it is enough for today."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:141
msgid "Yes I want even more training. (cost 200 circuits, 6 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:144
msgid "So lets start the second course?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:147
msgid "Very well."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:148
msgid "You must remain calm whilst shooting."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:149
msgid ""
"Try breathing out as you pull the trigger and squeeze it gently rather than "
"jerking it."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:150
msgid ""
"That's right. You will find yourself hitting the target much more often now."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:158
msgid "Yes I'm eager for more training. (cost 300 circuits, 9 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:161
msgid "So can you help me get even better with guns?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:164
msgid "Of course."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:165
msgid "Next lesson is hitting a moving target."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:166
msgid ""
"It's pretty simple really, just watch to see where it is going and then aim "
"slightly ahead in case you use a non-laser gun."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:167
msgid ""
"It's easy when you know how, especially with bots, because they tend to move "
"in straight lines, not bob and weave like people."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:168
msgid "I think that is enough training for now. Next time, firing on the move!"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:176
msgid "Yes I accept. (cost 400 circuits, 12 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:179
msgid "I'd like to learn how to be a master shot."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:182
msgid ""
"Firing on the move is difficult, but can make survival much more likely!"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:183
msgid ""
"The secret is to keep a stable platform and hold the weapon loosely so that "
"it doesn't jar."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:184
msgid ""
"Oh yes, and remember not to trip, because you should be looking where you "
"are firing, not where you are stepping."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:185
msgid "Keep practicing and you will get the hang of it eventually."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:193
msgid ""
"Yes I want to become a god in ranged combat. (cost 500 circuits, 15 training "
"points)"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:196
msgid "Teach me how to be at one with my weapon."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:199
msgid ""
"The ultimate secret to becoming a god in ranged combat is something you "
"should value."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:200
msgid "I don't tell everyone this, so keep it to yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:201
msgid "To become a god in ranged combat you need to..."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:202
msgid "...practice. A lot."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:203
msgid "Go ahead and use my firing range as much as you need."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:215
msgid "You need more gold."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:216
msgid "Please don't bother me if you can't pay me."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:217
msgid "Please defray the costs of the ammo used in training."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:218
msgid ""
"I repeat, you need to bring enough to pay for the practice targets you "
"destroy and for my time."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:219
msgid ""
"You don't have enough money! I cannot afford to just give away training for "
"free."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:220
msgid "Come back when you have enough circuits."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:221
msgid "So come back when you have some valuables."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:229
msgid "You are not ready. Go kill some bots and come back."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:230
msgid "Come back when you are mentally ready to learn."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:231
msgid "Come back after some more practice in the field."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:232
msgid ""
"Only a well prepared mind is open to the ultimate in ranged combat secrets."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:233
msgid ""
"Waving those circuits in front of me when you are too unfocused to train "
"won't help. I can take your money, but you won't learn anything."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:234
msgid ""
"But I don't think you have enough experience for this. Come back here after "
"you see some more action."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:235
msgid "Then come back when you have a real will to learn."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:236
msgid ""
"You don't have enough experience. Come here after you see some more action."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:240
msgid "What weapons are available to the members of the Red Guard?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:242
msgid ""
"Well, for novice members there are simple laser and plasma pistols. They "
"have their share of problems, but they do the trick nine times out of ten."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:243
msgid ""
"For bigger bots we have bigger guns. The exterminator is the best weapon "
"that we have. We hand them out only in case of an emergency or to highly "
"experienced people."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:248
msgid "Plasma sounds deadly."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:250
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:251
msgid ""
"While many people find the ammunition canisters too big, and the bullets too "
"slow, they cannot deny that once plasma hits, it leaves big holes."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:252
msgid ""
"Plasma is matter, ionised gas to be exact. It also happens to be hot enough "
"to make steel boil."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:253
msgid ""
"Most of the new recruits hate how hard to aim this weapon is. If bullets "
"were animals, then plasma would be a well fed cow. By the time it arrives at "
"the target, the bot is already a mile away."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:254
msgid ""
"If you are going to use plasma weapons you need to remember one thing: Don't "
"let the weapon get damaged."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:255
msgid ""
"Even though our armor is designed to resist high temperatures, once the "
"plasma containment module goes, you will die, along with anything within ten "
"meters of you."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:256
msgid ""
"Because of all those drawbacks plasma weapons are not too popular. Quite a "
"pity, they have great potential."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:261
msgid "Tell me more about laser weapons."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:263
msgid ""
"Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of "
"Radiation."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:264
msgid ""
"Laser is the technology employed in most of our weaponry. It uses a focused "
"light beam to cause damage."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:265
msgid ""
"Because the beam is composed out of light, it travels REALLY fast, at the "
"speed of lights so to say. Also it is not affected by gravity or wind, which "
"makes aiming easier."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:266
msgid ""
"However, other than being a good training tool for newbies, that design just "
"fails to deliver."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:267
msgid ""
"The shots tend to be underpowered, the gun takes a long while to power up "
"for a shot and can overheat during intense combat."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:268
msgid ""
"This is why I am trying to improve it, but so far I have had no success. I "
"just feel like giving up."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:273
msgid "I am curious about the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:275
msgid ""
"Sorry, but that is classified and confidential. I have said too much already."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:280
msgid "I will make it worth your while..."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:282
msgid "Intriguing."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:283
msgid "Fifty circuits per bit of information."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:284
msgid "So... What do you exactly want to know?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:289
msgid "How many exterminators does the Red Guard have?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:292
msgid ""
"It might come as a surprise to you, but we don't have many. A bit over "
"twenty, last time I checked."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:293
msgid ""
"However, as you can clearly see, it's more than enough to keep all of the "
"damn bots away."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:301
msgid "Well, I am a bit short on circuits right now..."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:303
msgid ""
"Linarian, I thought we had an agreement. Fifty per infobit. My silence can "
"be only broken with currency, so if you want to know, you have to pay."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:304
msgid "This conversation is now over."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:309
msgid "That is not a lot. Why there are so few of them right now?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:312
msgid "All of them were a very lucky find."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:313
msgid ""
"We found a crashed army truck on the Terminal Field. It had six crates "
"inside it, each containing five exterminators."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:314
msgid "We tried, but we could not replicate the technology, only bullets."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:315
msgid ""
"A few got damaged in battle, and we failed to recover five after a failed "
"scout mission. We have twenty-two right now."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:323
msgid "What is the exterminator ammunition made from?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:326
msgid ""
"We use radioactives, whatever type happens to be on hand. Mostly plutonium "
"and uranium, but we are not too picky."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:327
msgid ""
"When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards "
"into the mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:328
msgid ""
"That place was closed down ages ago because of high radiation levels. It's "
"full of good ores from which we make bullets and power our nuclear reactors."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:329
msgid ""
"We get our fission materials, and they serve their sentence. It was one of "
"the best ideas we have ever had."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:337
msgid "Tell me who designed the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:339
msgid "That answer is on the house. Heh."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:340
msgid "We do not know, Linarian. We have absolutely no clue."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:345
msgid "What was the failed mission?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:347
msgid "Ugh. That will cost you triple."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:348
msgid "No. Wait."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:349
msgid "I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:350
msgid ""
"Keep your money Linarian. No amount of circuits can make me talk about that "
"accursed day."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:355
msgid "What makes the exterminator so powerful?"
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:358
msgid ""
"This is a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature "
"nuclear explosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:359
msgid ""
"Of course the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation "
"by itself."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:360
msgid ""
"We never bothered with doing any research on that topic. It works and that "
"is enough for us."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:368
msgid "That is all I want to know."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:370
msgid "Very well. This conversation never happened."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:374
msgid "I will be going then."
msgstr ""

#: Benjamin.dialog:376
msgid "See you later!"
msgstr ""
