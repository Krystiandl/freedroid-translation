#: ./Chandra.dialog:39
msgid "Welcome. I am Chandra, the local sage in this old town."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:44
msgid "What can you tell me about this place?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:46
msgid ""
"This small town used to be a somewhat successful mining community, exporting r"
"are earth materials and other resources to the rest of the solar system."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:47
msgid ""
"The mines have depleted recently, however. The town was under a threat of bank"
"ruptcy. Living here became harder and many left to seek new opportunities else"
"where."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:48
msgid ""
"But now after the Great Assault, the rest of the planet gets bombarded by auto"
"mated bot ships every now and then, so being down here isn't so bad at all."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:49
msgid "Even with the Red Guard in charge, I suppose."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:54
msgid "Where can I get better equipment?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:56
msgid ""
"The shop is to the north, near the gate. Ms. Stone always has a good range of "
"equipment there, with fair prices too."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:57
msgid "Not that you have much choice."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:58
msgid ""
"Of course, the Red Guard always has the biggest guns and the best armor, but t"
"hey do not sell them to non-members."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:63
msgid "So what's so strange about the attack?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:65
msgid ""
"According to my calculations from the Fermi estimate, there are about seven mi"
"llion bots active in the region, everything from cleaner bots and servant droi"
"ds to much more dangerous ones."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:66
msgid ""
"Now, I think you will agree with me that the following statement is true: If b"
"ots, then death to everything alive."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:67
msgid "Now, I make the assumption that you and I are alive."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:68
msgid "Now, if we are not dead, and if bots are killing everything alive..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:69
msgid "... THEN SOMETHING IS NOT LOGICAL!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:70
msgid "Calm down. There must be some logic behind this."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:71
msgid "There is none!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:72
msgid "They could just enter the town and massacre everyone..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:73
msgid "But they do not even seem to try!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:74
msgid "This makes no sense at all!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:79
msgid "What do you know about the hostile bots?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:81
msgid ""
"The phenomenon of hostile bots has occupied my mind for quite some time. There"
" are some strange irrationalities in this behavior, that I cannot explain."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:82
msgid ""
"This concerns not only the suddenness of the attack but also the methods and t"
"he scale of it all."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:87
msgid "What types of bots are out there?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:89
msgid ""
"There are many. Each kind of bot has a number consisting of three digits. The "
"first one is the most significant, the class of a bot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:90
msgid "I know a bit about three classes."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:91
msgid ""
"The 100s are cleaning bots of old. Being that, they are quite common. Fortunat"
"ely for us they aren't as good at killing things as they are at cleaning up th"
"e mess afterwards."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:92
msgid ""
"The 200s are servant bots, designed to come quickly when summoned and be able "
"to lift heavy weights. That makes them more dangerous under most circumstances"
", so beware of being attacked by more than one at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:93
msgid ""
"Right now, an encounter with a 300 type bot equals death, so try to avoid it. "
"They were messenger bots before the Great Assault, which means they have super"
"b visual sensors and some are very fast."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:94
msgid ""
"There are many more classes out there. The military used bots, of course, and "
"they were used on ships, but I know nothing about those types."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:99
msgid "I want to leave this place."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:101
msgid "We all do, Linarian, we all do."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:102
msgid ""
"The act in question is made impossible by the quasi-infinite bots outside of t"
"he town walls."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:103
msgid "You cannot live for long out there."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:108
msgid "No, I meant I would like to leave this world."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:110
msgid ""
"Simple. Walk outside the town walls, and the bots will send you to the other w"
"orld within a few minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:111
msgid "Unless you mean leave the planet, in which case that is impossible."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:112
msgid "Most likely all of our cosmodromes have been destroyed in the bot attacks."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:117
msgid "I keep getting beaten up by the bots. What can I do?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:119
msgid "There are many things you can do. The first is to fight more bots."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:120
msgid ""
"Er... Wouldn't that cause me to get beaten up more and therefore be counter-pr"
"oductive?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:121
msgid ""
"Your logic is infallible, Linarian, but you are forgetting one thing: the more"
" you fight, the more experienced you become, and the better at surviving you g"
"et."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:122
msgid ""
"Also, if you have the money and can find a supplier, it is wise to invest in b"
"etter equipment - more protective clothing and better weaponry."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:123
msgid ""
"My advice is to invest in a ranged weapon. While that can create a huge hole i"
"n your wallet, it also creates several in the bots, and is better than a huge "
"hole in you."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:124
msgid ""
"Currently there is a ban on selling such things. The Red Guard wants to be the"
" only ones with good weapons."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:125
msgid ""
"Should you fail to find something decent to shoot or swing with, there are alw"
"ays other options."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:126
msgid ""
"Ewald, the barkeeper, usually sells an assortment of junk, but even he sometim"
"es has something worthwhile on display."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:127
msgid ""
"There was a person selling grenades, too. Eh... I forgot his name, my memory i"
"s not serving me very well today. He's a very mysterious fellow. Perhaps he ca"
"n help you."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:128
msgid "Other than that, you are on your own."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:133
msgid "Do you think I could join the guardians of this town?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:136
msgid ""
"The Red Guard...? Only if you're as strong and courageous as they are! There i"
"s no one better than the Red Guard! Nothing but top quality men there!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:138
msgid ""
"The Red Guard? Unlikely. You'd have to establish a reputation beforehand, and "
"demonstrate that you can fix things."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:139
msgid ""
"Also, the Red Guard is not a very popular organization, so if you do join them"
" then you can expect to be hated by nearly everyone here."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:140
msgid ""
"As the ancients said, 'Boni pastoris est tondere pecus, non deglubere'. A good"
" tax must be a reasonable tax."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:146
msgid "What bots are in the 100 class?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:148
msgid ""
"I know of two types, the 123 and the 139. The former is a simple cleaning bot,"
" and is fairly weak. The latter is a mobile trash compactor. Don't get your fl"
"ippers get caught in one of those."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:149
msgid "I've seen some of those on my way here. They were... Shooting at me."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:150
msgid "Many strange things have happened since the Great Assault."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:151
msgid ""
"Any way, because the class 100 bots are neither fast nor dangerous, the Red Gu"
"ard often uses them for target practice."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:152
msgid "If I were you, I would not overestimate them. "
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:153
msgid "Nec Hercules contra plures."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:158
msgid "What bots are in the 200 class?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:160
msgid ""
"In fitting with the lazy nature of humans, there are several servant bots of t"
"he 200 class."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:161
msgid ""
"The 247 is often called the 'Banshee'. Being a simple servant robot, it isn't "
"very well equipped to kill, although its arms are quite strong."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:162
msgid ""
"Also, as I said, the 200s were built to report quickly. The 247 is no exceptio"
"n, and moves faster than some of us can run. As a killer bot, it has a fast ra"
"te of attack. It is not something to be trifled with."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:163
msgid ""
"The 249 is a cheaper version of the Banshee. It uses a tripedal drive instead "
"of anti-gravity propulsion, and is therefore slower. However it is much more d"
"angerous: its machine gun has a very high rate of fire."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:164
msgid "Machine gun?! But... But it's a servant bot!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:165
msgid "I know, "
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:165
msgid ". I know."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:166
msgid ""
"Let's see... Oh, there is also the 296, which was used for serving drinks. Ewa"
"ld once had one of those in his bar."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:167
msgid "Once? What happened to it?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:168
msgid ""
"No one knows. One day it simply wasn't there. Ewald probably remembers more th"
"an I do, though."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:174
msgid "What other bots are out there?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:176
msgid ""
"Though I do not know the details, I assure you there are many. Robots and auto"
"mated machinery served almost every purpose you can imagine, and probably some"
" that you can't."
msgstr ""

#: ./Chandra.dialog:177
msgid ""
"They were used by the military, aboard ships, as security droids and more. Rig"
"ht now, however, most of the people who know them up close are pushing up dais"
"ies."
