msgid ""
"They will swap places, and you can put the other piece of armor back into your"

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can drag it into your field of view and drop it on the grou"

msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:226
msgid "I wouldn't want to lose any armor. What can I do about that?"
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:228

msgid ""
"Equipped items in poor condition will show up yellow and should turn red if in"

msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:232

msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:233
msgid "First, you can sell or discard the item."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:234
msgid ""
"Second, you can use your [b]repair equipment[/b] program on the item, which wi"
"ll repair the item at the cost of some of its durability."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:235
msgid ""
"Or third, you can have the item repaired at a shop, which maintains the item's"

msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:240
msgid "You mentioned discarding an item. Why would I want to do that?"
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:242
msgid "Well, I can think of a few reasons."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:243
msgid ""
"You might not have enough room in your inventory for an item you need more, or"
" can sell for more."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:244
msgid "If an item is close to being destroyed, you might also consider dropping it."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:245
msgid "And finally some items give negative status effects, and aren't worth selling."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:246
msgid "Armor or weapons may affect you in different ways."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:247
msgid ""
"Some will help you out, for example by increasing your cooling rate or increas"
"ing your dexterity. This is the work of specialized nanobots, but the reverse "
"can happen too."
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:252
msgid "Repair equipment program? How do I use that?"
msgstr ""

#: ./TutorialTom.dialog:254
msgid "Perhaps I should start by explaining programs in general."
msgstr ""
