"This small town used to be a somewhat successful mining community, exporting "

"The mines have depleted recently, however. The town was under a threat of "

"Ale teraz, po Wielkiej Walce, reszta planety jest bombardowana z każdą "
"chwilą przez zautomatyzowane statki botów tak więc istoty ginęły tutaj, ale "

"Oczywiście Czerwona Gwardia zawsze ma większą broń i lepszą amunicję, ale "

"The phenomenon of hostile bots has occupied my mind for quite some time. "
"There are some strange irrationalities in this behaviour, that I cannot "

msgstr "Fenomenem wrogich botów jest"

#: Chandra.dialog:86
msgid ""
"This concerns not only the suddenness of the attack but also the methods and "

msgid "What types of bots are out there?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:93
msgid ""
"There are many. Each kind of bot has a number consisting of three digits. "
"The first one is the most significant, the class of a bot."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:94
msgid "I know a bit about three classes."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:95
msgid ""
"The 100s are cleaning bots of old. Being that, they are quite common. "
"Fortunately for us they aren't as good at killing things as they are at "
"cleaning up the mess afterwards."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:96
msgid ""
"The 200s are servant bots, designed to come quickly when summoned and be "
"able to lift heavy weights. That makes them more dangerous under most "
"circumstances, so beware of being attacked by more than one at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:97
msgid ""
"Right now, an encounter with a 300 type bot equals death, so try to avoid "
"it. They were messenger bots before the Great Assault, which means they have "
"superb visual sensors and some are very fast."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:98
msgid ""
"There are many more classes out there. The military used bots, of course, "
"and they were used on ships, but I know nothing about those types."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:103
msgid "I want to leave this place."

#: Chandra.dialog:105
msgid "We all do, Linarian, we all do."

"The act in question is made impossible by the quasi-infinite bots outside of "

#: Chandra.dialog:107
msgid "You cannot live for long out there."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:112
msgid "No, I meant I would like to leave this world."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:114
msgid ""
"Simple. Walk outside the city walls, and the bots will send you to the other "
"world within a few minutes."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:115
msgid "Unless you mean leave the planet, in which case that is impossible."
msgstr ""

"Most likely all of our cosmodromes have been destroyed in the bot attacks."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:121
msgid "I keep getting beaten up by the bots. What can I do?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:123
msgid "There are many things you can do. The first is to fight more bots."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:124
msgid ""
"Er... Wouldn't that cause me to get beaten up more and therefore be counter-"
"productive?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:125
msgid ""
"Your logic is infallible, Linarian, but you are forgetting one thing: the "
"more you fight, the more experienced you become, and the better at surviving "
"you get."

#: Chandra.dialog:126
msgid ""
"Also, if you have the money and can find a supplier, it is wise to invest in "
"better equipment - more protective clothing and better weaponry."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:127
msgid ""
"My advice is to invest in a ranged weapon. While that can create a huge hole "
"in your wallet, it also creates several in the bots, and is better than a "
"huge hole in you."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:128
msgid ""
"Currently there is a ban on selling such things. The Red Guard wants to be "
"the only ones with good weapons."
msgstr ""

"Should you fail to find something decent to shoot or swing with, there are "
"always other options."

"Ewald, the barkeeper, usually sells an assortment of junk, but even he "

"There was a person selling grenades, too. Eh... I forgot his name, my memory "

msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:137
msgid "Do you think I could join the guardians of this town?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:139
msgid ""
"The Red Guard? Unlikely. You'd have to establish a reputation beforehand, "
"and demonstrate that you can fix things."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:140
msgid ""
"Also, the Red Guard is not a very popular organization, so if you do join "
"them then you can expect to be hated by nearly everyone here."

"As the ancients said, 'Boni pastoris est tondere pecus, non deglubere'. A "

msgid "What bots are in the 100 class?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:148
msgid ""
"I know of two types, the 123 and the 139. The former is a simple cleaning "
"bot, and is fairly weak. The latter is a mobile trash compactor. Don't get "
"your flippers get caught in one of those."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:149
msgid "I've seen some of those on my way here. They were... Shooting at me."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:150
msgid "Many strange things have happened since the Great Assault."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:151
msgid ""
"Any way, because the class 100 bots are neither fast nor dangerous, the Red "
"Guard often uses them for target practice."

msgid "What bots are in the 200 class?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:160
msgid ""
"In fitting with the lazy nature of humans, there are several servant bots of "
"the 200 class."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:161
msgid ""
"The 247 is often called the 'Banshee'. Being a simple servant robot, it "
"isn't very well equipped to kill, although its arms are quite strong."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:162
msgid ""
"Also, as I said, the 200s were built to report quickly. The 247 is no "
"exception, and moves faster than some of us can run. As a killer bot, it has "
"a fast rate of attack. It is not something to be trifled with."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:163
msgid ""
"The 249 is a cheaper version of the Banshee. It uses a tripedal drive "
"instead of anti-gravity propulsion, and is therefore slower. However it is "
"much more dangerous: its machine gun has a very high rate of fire."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:164
msgid "Machine gun?! But... But it's a servant bot!"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:165
msgid "I know, "

#: Chandra.dialog:165
msgid ". I know."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:166
msgid ""
"Let's see... Oh, there is also the 296, which was used for serving drinks. "
"Ewald once had one of those in his bar."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:167
msgid "Once? What happened to it?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:168
msgid ""
"No one knows. One day it simply wasn't there. Ewald probably remembers more "
"than I do, though."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:174
msgid "What other bots are out there?"
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:176
msgid ""
"Though I do not know the details, I assure you there are many. Robots and "
"automated machinery served almost every purpose you can imagine, and "
"probably some that you can't."
msgstr ""

#: Chandra.dialog:177
msgid ""
"They were used by the military, aboard ships, as security droids and more. "
"Right now, however, most of the people who know them up close are pushing up "
