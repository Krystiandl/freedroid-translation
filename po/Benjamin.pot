msgid "You must remain calm whilst shooting."

msgid ""
"Try breathing out as you pull the trigger, and squeeze it gently rather than j"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:146

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:162

"It's pretty simple really, just watch to see where it is going and then aim sl"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:163
msgid ""
"It's easy when you know how, especially with bots, because they tend to move i"

"I don't think you have enough experience for this. Come back after you see som"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:236
msgid "What weapons are available to the members of the Red Guard?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:238
msgid ""
"Well, for novice members there are simple laser and plasma pistols. They have "
"their share of problems, but they do the trick nine times out of ten."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:239
msgid ""
"For bigger bots we have bigger guns. The exterminator is the best weapon that "
"we have. We hand them out only in case of an emergency, or to highly experienc"
"ed people."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:244
msgid "Plasma sounds deadly."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:246
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:247
msgid ""
"While many people find the ammunition canisters too big, and the bullets too s"
"low, they cannot deny that once plasma hits, it leaves big holes."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:248
msgid ""
"Plasma is matter, ionised gas to be exact. It also happens to be hot enough to"
" make steel boil."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:249
msgid ""
"Most of the new recruits hate how hard this weapon is to aim. If bullets were "
"animals, then plasma would be a well fed cow. By the time it arrives at the ta"
"rget, the bot is already a mile away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:250
msgid ""
"If you are going to use plasma weapons you need to remember one thing: Don't l"
"et the weapon get damaged."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:251
msgid ""
"Even though our armor is designed to resist high temperatures, once the plasma"
" containment module goes, you will die, along with anything within ten meters "
"of you."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:252
msgid ""
"Because of all those drawbacks, plasma weapons are not too popular. Quite a pi"
"ty, they have great potential."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:257
msgid "Tell me more about laser weapons."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:259
msgid ""
"Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatio"
"n."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:260
msgid ""
"Laser is the technology employed in most of our weaponry. It uses a focused li"
"ght beam to cause damage."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:261
msgid ""
"Because the beam is composed out of light, it travels REALLY fast, at the spee"
"d of light, so to say. Also it is not affected by gravity or wind, which makes"
" aiming easier."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:262
msgid ""
"However, other than being a good training tool for newbies, that design just f"
"ails to deliver."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:263
msgid ""
"The shots tend to be underpowered, the gun takes a long while to power up for "
"a shot, and it can overheat during intense combat."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:264
msgid ""
"This is why I am trying to improve it, but so far I have had no success. I'm f"
"eeling pretty discouraged about it."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:269
msgid "I am curious about the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:271
msgid "Sorry, but that is classified and confidential. I have said too much already."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:276
msgid "I will make it worth your while..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:278
msgid "Intriguing."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:279
msgid "Fifty circuits per bit of information."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:280
msgid "So... What do you exactly want to know?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:285
msgid "How many exterminators does the Red Guard have?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:288
msgid ""
"It might come as a surprise to you, but we don't have many. A little over twen"
"ty, last time I checked."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:289
msgid ""
"Thankfully, as you can clearly see, it's more than enough to keep all of the c"
"ursed bots away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:297
msgid "Well, I am a bit short on circuits right now..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:299
msgid ""
"Linarian, I thought we had an agreement. Fifty per infobit. My silence can be "
"only broken with currency, so if you want to know, you have to pay."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:300
msgid "This conversation is now over."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:305
msgid "That is not many. Why there are so few of them right now?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:308
msgid "They were a very lucky find."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:309
msgid ""
"We found a crashed army truck on the Terminal Field. It had six crates inside "
"it, each containing five exterminators."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:310
msgid "We tried, but we could not replicate the technology, only bullets."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:311
msgid ""
"A few got damaged in battle, and we failed to recover five after a failed scou"
"t mission. We have twenty-two right now."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:319
msgid "What is the exterminator ammunition made from?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:322
msgid ""
"We use radioactive isotopes, whatever type happens to be on hand. Mostly pluto"
"nium and uranium, but we are not too picky."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:323
msgid ""
"When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards in"
"to mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:324
msgid ""
"That place was closed down ages ago because of high radiation levels, but it's"
" full of good ore from which we make bullets and power our nuclear reactors."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:325
msgid ""
"We get our fission materials, and they serve their sentence. It was one of the"
" best ideas we have ever had."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:333
msgid "Tell me who designed the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:335
msgid "That answer is on the house. Heh."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:336
msgid "We do not know, Linarian. We have absolutely no clue."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:341
msgid "What was the failed mission?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:343
msgid "Ugh. That will cost you triple."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:344
msgid "No. Wait."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:345
msgid "I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:346
msgid ""
"Keep your money Linarian. No amount of circuits can make me talk about that ac"
"cursed day."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:351
msgid "What makes the exterminator so powerful?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:354
msgid ""
"That's a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature nuclear e"
"xplosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:355
msgid ""
"Of course, the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation by"
" itself."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:356
msgid ""
"We never bothered with doing much research on that topic. It works, and that i"
"s enough for us."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:364
msgid "That is all I want to know."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:366
msgid "Very well. Oh... This conversation never happened."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:370
msgid "I will be going then."
msgstr ""
