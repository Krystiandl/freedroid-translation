#: ./Benjamin.dialog:92
msgid "Oh, you are ready for some more training?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:93
msgid "It will of course cost a bit more money as well as mental focus on your part."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:94
msgid ""
"It will take you two hundred circuits and double the effort on your part to be"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:98
msgid "I see you have taken a liking to guns."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:99
msgid ""

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:103
msgid "Oh, you want to become a real master with shooters?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:104
msgid ""
"It will cost you 400 valuable circuits and an awful lot of mental focusing on "

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:108
msgid ""
"To become a true god of firearms, just like me, you need ridiculous amounts of"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:109

"It will of course cost a fair bit of cold, hard circuits as well. 500, to be p"

"Sign up for a course in improving my ranged weapons skill. (cost 100 circuits,"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:122
msgid "Yes, I'd like some basic training in ranged combat."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:125
msgid "Suits me well, I'm not busy at the moment anyway."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:126
msgid ""
"Now the most important thing is that you turn off the auto-aim on your weapon,"
" like this."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:127
msgid ""
"Otherwise your weapon might 'help' you and shoot somewhere you didn't intend t"
"o fire."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:128
msgid "Next important thing is to remember how to properly fire a shot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:129
msgid "Watch your target closely. Pretend you're moving with it. Aim for the head."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:130
msgid "When you feel completely in sync with your target, then you pull the trigger."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:131
msgid "Good. You are learning fast. Try it a few more times."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:132
msgid "Good. I think that it is enough for today."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:140
msgid "Yes I want even more training. (cost 200 circuits, 6 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:143
msgid "So lets start the second course?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:146
msgid "Very well."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:147
msgid "You must remain calm whilst shooting."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:148
msgid ""
"Try breathing out as you pull the trigger and squeeze it gently rather than je"
"rking it."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:149
msgid "That's right. You will find yourself hitting the target much more often now."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:157
msgid "Yes I'm eager for more training. (cost 300 circuits, 9 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:160
msgid "So can you help me get even better with guns?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:163
msgid "Of course."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:164
msgid "Next lesson is hitting a moving target."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:165
msgid ""
"It's pretty simple really, just watch to see where it is going and then aim sl"
"ightly ahead in case you use a non-laser gun."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:166
msgid ""
"It's easy when you know how, especially with bots, because they tend to move i"
"n straight lines, not bob and weave like people."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:167
msgid "I think that is enough training for now. Next time, firing on the move!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:175
msgid "Yes I accept. (cost 400 circuits, 12 training points)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:178
msgid "I'd like to learn how to be a master shot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:181
msgid "Firing on the move is difficult, but can make survival much more likely!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:182
msgid ""
"The secret is to keep a stable platform and hold the weapon loosely so that it"
" doesn't jar."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:183
msgid ""
"Oh yes, and remember not to trip, because you should be looking where you are "
"firing, not where you are stepping."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:184
msgid "Keep practicing and you will get the hang of it eventually."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:192

"Yes I want to become a god in ranged combat. (cost 500 circuits, 15 training p"
"oints)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:195
msgid "Teach me how to be at one with my weapon."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:198
msgid ""
"The ultimate secret to becoming a god in ranged combat is something you should"
" value."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:199
msgid "I don't tell everyone this, so keep it to yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:200
msgid "To become a god in ranged combat you need to..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:201
msgid "...practice. A lot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:202
msgid "Go ahead and use my firing range as much as you need."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:239
msgid "What weapons are available to the members of the Red Guard?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:241
msgid ""
"Well, for novice members there are simple laser and plasma pistols. They have "
"their share of problems, but they do the trick nine times out of ten."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:242
msgid ""
"For bigger bots we have bigger guns. The exterminator is the best weapon that "
"we have. We hand them out only in case of an emergency or to highly experience"
"d people."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:247
msgid "Plasma sounds deadly."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:249
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:250
msgid ""
"While many people find the ammunition canisters too big, and the bullets too s"
"low, they cannot deny that once plasma hits, it leaves big holes."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:251
msgid ""
"Plasma is matter, ionised gas to be exact. It also happens to be hot enough to"
" make steel boil."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:252
msgid ""
"Most of the new recruits hate how hard to aim this weapon is. If bullets were "
"animals, then plasma would be a well fed cow. By the time it arrives at the ta"
"rget, the bot is already a mile away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:253
msgid ""
"If you are going to use plasma weapons you need to remember one thing: Don't l"
"et the weapon get damaged."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:254
msgid ""
"Even though our armor is designed to resist high temperatures, once the plasma"
" containment module goes, you will die, along with anything within ten meters "
"of you."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:255
msgid ""
"Because of all those drawbacks plasma weapons are not too popular. Quite a pit"
"y, they have great potential."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:260
msgid "Tell me more about laser weapons."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:262
msgid ""
"Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatio"
"n."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:263
msgid ""
"Laser is the technology employed in most of our weaponry. It uses a focused li"
"ght beam to cause damage."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:264
msgid ""
"Because the beam is composed out of light, it travels REALLY fast, at the spee"
"d of lights so to say. Also it is not affected by gravity or wind, which makes"
" aiming easier."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:265
msgid ""
"However, other than being a good training tool for newbies, that design just f"
"ails to deliver."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:266
msgid ""
"The shots tend to be underpowered, the gun takes a long while to power up for "
"a shot and can overheat during intense combat."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:267
msgid ""
"This is why I am trying to improve it, but so far I have had no success. I jus"
"t feel like giving up."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:272
msgid "I am curious about the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:274
msgid "Sorry, but that is classified and confidential. I have said too much already."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:281
msgid "Intriguing."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:282
msgid "Fifty circuits per bit of information."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:283
msgid "So... What do you exactly want to know?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:288
msgid "How many exterminators does the Red Guard have?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:291
msgid ""
"It might come as a surprise to you, but we don't have many. A bit over twenty,"
" last time I checked."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:292
msgid ""
"However, as you can clearly see, it's more than enough to keep all of the damn"
" bots away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:300
msgid "Well, I am a bit short on circuits right now..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:302
msgid ""
"Linarian, I thought we had an agreement. Fifty per infobit. My silence can be "
"only broken with currency, so if you want to know, you have to pay."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:303
msgid "This conversation is now over."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:308
msgid "That is not a lot. Why there are so few of them right now?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:311
msgid "All of them were a very lucky find."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:312
msgid ""
"We found a crashed army truck on the Terminal Field. It had six crates inside "
"it, each containing five exterminators."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:313
msgid "We tried, but we could not replicate the technology, only bullets."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:314
msgid ""
"A few got damaged in battle, and we failed to recover five after a failed scou"
"t mission. We have twenty-two right now."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:322
msgid "What is the exterminator ammunition made from?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:325
msgid ""
"We use radioactives, whatever type happens to be on hand. Mostly plutonium and"
" uranium, but we are not too picky."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:326
msgid ""
"When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards in"
"to the mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:327
msgid ""
"That place was closed down ages ago because of high radiation levels. It's ful"
"l of good ores from which we make bullets and power our nuclear reactors."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:328
msgid ""
"We get our fission materials, and they serve their sentence. It was one of the"
" best ideas we have ever had."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:336
msgid "Tell me who designed the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:338
msgid "That answer is on the house. Heh."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:339
msgid "We do not know, Linarian. We have absolutely no clue."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:344
msgid "What was the failed mission?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:346
msgid "Ugh. That will cost you triple."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:347
msgid "No. Wait."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:348
msgid "I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:349
msgid ""
"Keep your money Linarian. No amount of circuits can make me talk about that ac"
"cursed day."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:354
msgid "What makes the exterminator so powerful?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:357
msgid ""
"This is a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature nuclear "
"explosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:358
msgid ""
"Of course the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation by "
"itself."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:359
msgid ""
"We never bothered with doing any research on that topic. It works and that is "
"enough for us."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:367
msgid "That is all I want to know."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:369
msgid "Very well. This conversation never happened."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:373
msgid "I will be going then."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:375
msgid "See you later!"
msgstr ""
