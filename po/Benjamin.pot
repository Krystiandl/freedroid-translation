msgid "I'm experimenting with new designs. I want to redesign the laser pistol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lot of energy is wasted somewhere during firing, and I have no idea where. I"
"f I could find the source of the problem, the gun would become much more power"
"ful."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:50
msgid ""
"So far all my prototypes have failed. Mostly overheating and jamming. Sometime"
"s I wonder if I am doing something wrong."

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:55
msgid ""
"Did you think about somehow gathering the excess heat and using it to make the"
" beam stronger?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:57
msgid "Hmm... There might be something in that idea. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:63
msgid "If I were you, I would focus my work on the firing rate."

msgid "Hmm... I will think about it. Hmm..."

msgid ""
"You know, laser pistols are not a very promising weapon. I think you should wo"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:73
msgid "Yeah, maybe you are right. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:79
msgid "What weapons are available to the members of the Red Guard?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:81
msgid ""
"Well, for novice members there are simple laser and plasma pistols. They have "
"their share of problems, but they do the trick nine times out of ten."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:82
msgid ""
"For bigger bots we have bigger guns. The exterminator is the best weapon that "
"we have. We hand them out only in case of an emergency or to highly experience"
"d people."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:87
msgid "Plasma sounds deadly."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:89
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:90
msgid ""
"While many people find the ammunition canisters too big, and the bullets too s"
"low, they cannot deny that once plasma hits, it leaves big holes."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:91
msgid ""
"Plasma is matter, ionised gas to be exact. It also happens to be hot enough to"
" make steel boil."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:92
msgid ""
"Most of the new recruits hate how hard to aim this weapon is. If bullets were "
"animals, then plasma would be a well fed cow. By the time it arrives at the ta"
"rget, the bot is already a mile away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:93
msgid ""
"If you are going to use plasma weapons you need to remember one thing: Don't l"

msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:94
msgid ""
"Even though our armor is designed to resist high temperatures, once the plasma"
" containment module goes, you will die, along with anything within ten meters "
"of you."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:95
msgid ""
"Because of all those drawbacks plasma weapons are not too popular. Quite a pit"
"y, they have great potential."

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:100
msgid "Tell me more about laser weapons."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:102
msgid ""
"Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiatio"
"n."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:103
msgid ""
"Laser is the technology employed in most of our weaponry. It uses a focused li"
"ght beam to cause damage."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:104
msgid ""
"Because the beam is composed out of light, it travels REALLY fast, at the spee"
"d of lights so to say. Also it is not affected by gravity or wind, which makes"
" aiming easier."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:105
msgid ""
"However, other than being a good training tool for newbies, that design just f"
"ails to deliver."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:106
msgid ""
"The shots tend to be underpowered, the gun takes a long while to power up for "
"a shot and can overheat during intense combat."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:107
msgid ""
"This is why I am trying to improve it, but so far I have had no success. I jus"
"t feel like giving up."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:112
msgid "I am curious about the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:114
msgid "Sorry, but that is classified and confidential. I have said too much already."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:119
msgid "Can you teach me how to properly use rifles and guns?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:122
msgid ""
"If anyone in this city knows more about guns than me, then my name's not Benja"
"min."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:123
msgid ""
"Of course, I will need compensation for the ammunition spent in the training a"
"nd for my time."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:124
msgid ""
"Say... A hundred circuits and three training points should be enough for a beg"
"inner lesson."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:127
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:138
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:157
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:167
msgid "Interested?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:129
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:140
msgid ""
"Waving that cash in front of me when you are too unfocused to train won't help"
". I can take your money, but you won't learn anything."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:130
msgid "Come back when you have both."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:133
msgid "Oh, you are ready for some more training?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:134
msgid "It will of course cost a bit more money as well as mental focus on your part."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:135
msgid ""
"It will take you two hundred circuits and double the effort on your part to be"
"come a true apprentice."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:141
msgid ""
"You don't have enough money! I cannot afford to just give away training for fr"
"ee."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:144
msgid "I see you have taken a liking to guns."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:145
msgid ""
"But the next step will cost even more money and require the mental focus equal"
"ing all your previous training."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:149
msgid ""
"But I dont think you have enough experience for this. Come back here after you"
" see some more action."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:150
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:170
msgid "Then come back when you have both."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:153
msgid "Oh, you want to become a real master with shooters?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:154
msgid ""
"It will cost you 400 valuable circuits and an awful lot of mental focusing on "
"the task."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:159
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:169
msgid "You don't have enough experience. Come here after you see some more action."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:160
msgid "So come back when you have both."

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:163
msgid ""
"To become a true god of firearms, just like me, you need ridiculous amounts of"
" training."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:164
msgid ""
"It will of course cost a fair bit of cold, hard cash as well. 500, to be preci"
"se."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:173
msgid "Sorry, there is no human alive that could give you further training."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:184
msgid ""
"Yes, I want to improve my ranged weapons skill. (cost 3 training points, 100 c"
"ash)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:188
msgid ""
"Now the most important thing is that you turn off the auto-aim on your weapon,"
" like this."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:189
msgid ""
"Otherwise your weapon might 'help' you and shoot somewhere you didn't intend t"
"o fire."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:190
msgid "Next important thing is to remember how to properly fire a shot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:191
msgid "Watch your target closely.  Pretend you're moving with it. Aim for the head."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:192
msgid "When you feel completely in sync with your target, then you pull the trigger."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:193
msgid "Good. You are learning fast. Try it a few more times."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:194
msgid "Good. I think that it is enough for today."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:198
msgid "You are not ready.  Go kill some bots and come back."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:202
msgid "You need more gold."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:207
msgid "Yes I want even more training. (cost 6 training points, 200 cash)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:211
msgid "You must remain calm whilst shooting."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:212
msgid ""
"Try breathing out as you pull the trigger and squeeze it gently rather than je"
"rking it."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:213
msgid "That's right. You will find yourself hitting the target much more often now."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:218
#: ./Benjamin.dialog:238
msgid "Come back when you are ready to learn."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:221
msgid "Please don't bother me if you can't pay me."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:226
msgid "Yes I accept. (cost 9 training points, 300 cash)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:230
msgid "Next lesson is hitting a moving target."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:231
msgid ""
"It's pretty simple really, just watch to see where it is going and then aim sl"
"ightly ahead in case you use a non-laser gun."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:232
msgid ""
"It's easy when you know how, especially with bots, because they tend to move i"
"n straight lines, not bob and weave like people."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:233
msgid "I think that is enough training for now. Next time, firing on the move!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:241
msgid "Please defray the costs of the ammo used in training."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:246
msgid "Yes I accept. (cost 12 training points, 400 cash)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:250
msgid "Firing on the move is difficult, but can make survival much more likely!"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:251
msgid ""
"The secret is to keep a stable platform and hold the weapon loosely so that it"
" doesn't jar."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:252
msgid ""
"Oh yes, and remember not to trip, because you should be looking where you are "
"firing, not where you are stepping."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:253
msgid "Keep practicing and you will get the hang of it eventually."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:258
msgid "Come back after some more practice in the field."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:261
msgid "Please bring enough to pay for the targets you destroy."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:266
msgid ""
"Yes I want to become a god in ranged combat. (cost 15 training points, 500 cas"
"h)"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:270
msgid "I don't tell everyone this, so keep it to yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:271
msgid "To become a god in ranged combat you need to..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:272
msgid "...practice. A lot."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:273
msgid "Go ahead and use my firing range as much as you need."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:278
msgid "Only a well prepared mind is open to the ultimate in ranged combat secrets."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:281
msgid ""
"The ultimate secret to becoming a god in ranged combat is something you should"
" value."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:286
msgid "No, thanks, I dont feel I can afford that currently."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:294
msgid "Intriguing."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:295
msgid "Fifty circuits per bit of information."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:296
msgid "So... What do you exactly want to know?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:301
msgid "How many exterminators does the Red Guard have?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:304
msgid ""
"It might come as a surprise to you, but we don't have many. A bit over twenty,"
" last time I checked."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:305
msgid ""
"However, as you can clearly see, it's more than enough to keep all of the damn"
" bots away."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:313
msgid "Well, I am a bit short on cash right now..."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:315
msgid ""
"Linarian, I thought we had an agreement. Fifty per infobit. My silence can be "
"only broken with currency, so if you want to know, you have to pay."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:316
msgid "This conversation is now over."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:321
msgid "That is not a lot. Why there are so few of them right now?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:324
msgid "All of them were a very lucky find."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:325
msgid ""
"We found a crashed army truck on the Terminal Field. It had six crates inside "
"it, each containing five exterminators."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:326
msgid "We tried, but we could not replicate the technology, only bullets."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:327
msgid ""
"A few got damaged in battle, and we failed to recover five after a failed scou"
"t mission. We have twenty-two right now."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:335
msgid "What is the exterminator ammunition made from?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:338
msgid ""
"We use radioactives, whatever type happens to be on hand. Mostly plutonium and"
" uranium, but we are not too picky."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:339
msgid ""
"When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards in"
"to the mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:340
msgid ""
"That place was closed down ages ago because of high radiation levels. It's ful"
"l of good ores from which we make bullets and power our nuclear reactors."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:341
msgid ""
"We get our fission materials, and they serve their sentence. It was one of the"
" best ideas we have ever had."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:349
msgid "Tell me who designed the exterminator."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:351
msgid "That answer is on the house. Heh."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:352
msgid "We do not know, Linarian. We have absolutely no clue."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:357
msgid "What was the failed mission?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:359
msgid "Ugh. That will cost you triple."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:360
msgid "No. Wait."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:361
msgid "I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:362
msgid ""
"Keep your money Linarian. No amount of circuits can make me talk about that ac"
"cursed day."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:367
msgid "What makes the exterminator so powerful?"
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:370
msgid ""
"This is a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature nuclear "
"explosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:371
msgid ""
"Of course the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation by "
"itself."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:372
msgid ""
"We never bothered with doing any research on that topic. It works and that is "
"enough for us."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:380
msgid "That is all I want to know."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:382
msgid "Very well. This conversation never happened."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:386
msgid "I will be going then."
msgstr ""

#: ./Benjamin.dialog:388
msgid "See you later!"
