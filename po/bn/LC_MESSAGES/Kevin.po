msgid ""
"Oh, I seem to have found the guy the town guard was raving on about. Better "

#: Kevin.dialog:77

"I've obtained secret data on the town surroundings. We'll need a big "

msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:113

"That would be great of course. I know that the old town is maintaining a "

msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:114
msgid ""
"The only problem is, I can't go back to town. They would probably kill me "

msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:115
msgid ""
"Also, the cluster is inside of the guard citadel. I hear that only members "

msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:116
msgid ""
"But maybe you can arrange that somehow. For me it would be impossible, "

#: Kevin.dialog:196
msgid ""
"There is tremendous importance in it. But the project is in danger. There "

#: Kevin.dialog:197

"Now, if you go down there and make the power flow stable, then I'll find the "
"time to teach you something."
msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:200
msgid ""
"Kevin has a problem with his energy supply. His bots keep rebooting the "
"system, and he cannot conduct any experiments with an unstable power supply. "
"My job is to stabilize the power. I think that implies removing the stupid "
"bots."
msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:203
msgid ""
"As I've told you, I cannot teach you anything right now. I don't have the "
"time."
msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:204
msgid ""
"I must see that the flaky energy stream is distributed in such a way that my "

msgstr ""

#: Kevin.dialog:205
msgid ""
"If you get rid of the maintenance bots on the second underground level of "

"Good. The most important thing about hacking is to understand the nature of "
